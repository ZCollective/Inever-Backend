# The idea

A bunch of lads wanted to play the well known game of I never... while having a blast.

The amount of ads and generally annoying behaviour of the already available apps lead us to start
developing our own version of this great party piece. Just without ads.

You can find the Frontend App part of the game here: https://github.com/ZCollective/Inever-Android

# Free? Foss? What?

Since we do not want to keep the source code to ourselves, or earn money with the game we decided to make 
the source code publicly available.
